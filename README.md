# Matrix Calculus and Multivariate Statistics
This respository contains projects made for the Matrix Calculus and Multivatiate Statistics course at the AGH UST in 2024 by 2 students (one team).
All provided algorithms are from scratch as a result of their work after hours. Given tasks were intended to learn us how to apply mathematical solutions
in Machine Learning in order to obtain faster and mor eefficient code performance. Below are presented topics of solved tasks.
